# Grime-Song-Generator

The Grime Song Generator is a tool for music producers, makers and fans to explore the sounds of the 'Grime' genre. This application provides a sketchpad for users to quickly create melodies and compositions, with the option of doing so over a wide choice of backing tracks in order to get a feel for the genre, as well as the creative and techical processes involved in the creation of music. 

![Mock Up](documentation/screenshots/mockups1.jpg)


The application consists of four sections: the instructions section, the sound selection section, the playground section, and the loop player section.

## User Experience (UX)

- __Design Choices__

The overall feel of the site design is gritty, dark and minimal as this matches the style and aethetic of the 'Grime' genre.  

- __Font__
The font used throughout the site is Chakra Petch to give the site an industrial feel, achieved by the lack of curves in the letters. This also works in contrast to the heavily curved, abstract shapes used in the background.

- __Icons__
The icons used from font awesome were chosen for their simplicity to ensure all users can identify them.

- __Colours__

The colours used are intentionally minimal. The primary colours used in the background are black and grey. To contrast used, the font throughout is white. 
The other colours featured in the website are from the release artworks, or artist profiles. There is no set colour scheme for these as they are dependant on the artist, however this in itself is a stylistic choice that highlights the individuality and uniqueness of the artists against the minimal colour scheme of the main website.

- __First Time Users__

1.As a first time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and the record labels role as a promoter of existing artists, and a platform for emerging artists.

2.As a first time user, I want to be able to get good visual representation of the musical content released without having heard the music, from the aesthetic of the website, artist profiles and release artworks.

3.As a first time user, I want clear and distinguishable sections that are easy to find and move between. 

4.As a first time user, I want to be able to leave the website to find out more via social media or access the music directly.

- __Returning Users__

1. As a returning user, I want to easily find the links I didn't use the first time, for instance if I checked out the social media, I now want to find the music.

2. As a returning user, I want to be easily able to find what updated have occurred since my last visit. 

3. As a returning user, I want to know how to submit music, and see how I'll be represented. 

## Wireframes

As part of the planning, I completed the below Wireframes using Balsamiq:

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Artist page and Demo page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

![Nav Bar](documentation/screenshots/navbar.png)

- __The Logo__
 
  - Whilst part of the Navbar, it's important to highlight the logo on the left hand side. The image contains the signature Replica Recordings image, serving as both the quickest possible way for a user to identify the brand, and an eye-catching anchor at the top of the page that will return the user to the home page from other parts of the site. 

  ![Logo](assets/images/replicalogo.jpg)
  

- __Title Section__

  - The landing includes a banner with text overlay to allow the user to see the actual name and description of the brand for the first time. 
  - This section involves a  transulcent banner over a deliberately abstract yet eye catching image for the text and description while also helping to create an initial atmosphere for the site.

![Home Page](documentation/screenshots/homepage.png)

- __About Section__

  - The 'About' section will allow the user to quickly immerse themselves in the ethos of the label and encourage users to explore the other sections of the site.
  - This user will quickly understand the value the label places on it's artists and the music it releases and be encouraged to do the same. This should result in the user to begin exploring the artists, or be inspired to get involved in the label themselves. 

  ![About](documentation/screenshots/about-screenshot.png)

- __Latest Section__

  - This section will allow the user to see exactly how the label operates on a day to day basis, it gives concise summaries of the latest releases, events and news.  
  - The busy schedule of releases, events and news will be regularly updated, this will encourage the user to regularly return to the site and serves to demonstrate the impressive and involved work rate of the label and artists. 

    ![Latest](documentation/screenshots/latest-screenshot.png)
  
  - __Releases Section__

  - This section will provider the user with a sample of some of the artwork from the latest Replica Recordings releases. The aim is to give a visual representation of the primary content the label puts out. 

     ![Releases](documentation/screenshots/releases-screenshot.png)

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section is split in two halves. The left half includes links to the social media sites for Replica Recordins under a 'Find Us' heading. The right half includes links to streaming platforms so they user can engage directly with the content being released by the label and it's artists. All links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it directs them straight to the musical content, and social media links to follow and engage with on an ongoing basis. 

![Footer](documentation/screenshots/footer.png)

- __Artist Page__

  - This page will give the user pictures of the artists or their releases along with a text blurb explaining key information about each one. 
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to view the artists themselves, as will as specific information about them, and as a prospective artist be able to preview how they would be depicted on the site should they become part of the label.  

![Artists](documentation/screenshots/artists.png)

- __Demo Page__

  - This page will allow the user to become familiar with how the process of signing music works through Replica Recordings. The aim of this page is to demonstrate to prospective artists the clear, and simple process of how to submit music, and gives insight to general users and fans by including a summary of the approach in the 'If we like it, we'll sign it' section.

## Testing 


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
 No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator for index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://thomg1.github.io/Replica-Recordings/index.html)

  ![Demos-validation](documentation/screenshots/demos-val.png)


- CSS
  
  Some errors were found when passing through the official CSS validator, although on investigation, it appears the errors displayed are a result of bootstrap, rather than errors in the CSS code itself
   [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fthomg1.github.io%2FReplica-Recordings)
  ![css-validation](documentation/screenshots/css-val.png)

  When the code itself is copied and pasted into the validator, this displays no errors:
